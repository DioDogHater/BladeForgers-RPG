#-- About this project --
I am making this project as a way to test my game making abilities while also wasting time as a no-life.

# Why the hell is it in C?
Because I want to affirm my sigma-ness in a world of beta noobs. Also because I enjoy C more than other languages.

# Did you smoke before coding or something? This code is ass!
Remind yourself before posting any vulgar comments or death threats that I am still in high school, and I consider myself an intermediate at programming

# BUGS!!! HELP ME I GOT 50 FPS!!!
This game is supposed to run at 120 fps by default.
If the game runs badly on your system or it simply doesn't fucking work, please attempt to contact me or something.
\- NOTE: I am very lazy, so if you do reach me, I might give up on fixing the issue if it is too problematic

# Note to the people who stumbled on this page
Thank you for finding this project, and I hope you enjoy looking at my code.
If there any improvements you would make, please tell me so I could add them.
\- NOTE: I don't want any dumb shit asking me to add multiplayer or something thinking I'm some kind of networking genius.
